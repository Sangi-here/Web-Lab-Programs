<img src="tree.jpeg" alt="TREE">
<p>A tree is a perennial plant with a long lifespan, characterized by a single, sturdy trunk that supports a crown of branches and leaves. Its root system anchors it to the ground and absorbs water and nutrients from the soil. Trees perform photosynthesis to create energy, provide habitats and food for wildlife, and offer essential resources like oxygen, wood, and food for humans, playing a vital role in ecosystems.
