<p>Diwali, or Deepavali, is India's "Festival of Lights," celebrating the spiritual victory of light over darkness and good over evil. People thoroughly clean and decorate their homes with colorful rangoli, flower garlands, and, most importantly, rows of earthen oil lamps called diyas. The festival is marked by feasting on traditional sweets, exchanging gifts with family and friends, and often culminates with fireworks. It is a time for joyous celebration, strengthening family bonds, and spreading messages of unity, kindness, and hope, with special prayers also offered to Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity. </p>
