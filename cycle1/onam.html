<p>Onam is a vibrant ten-day harvest festival in Kerala, India, celebrating the return of the benevolent King Mahabali to his people, marked by grand feasts called Onasadya, intricate flower carpet designs called Pookalam, traditional boat races known as Vallam Kali, colorful dances like Thiruvathira and Pulikali, and a spirit of unity, prosperity, and cultural pride for the Malayali community worldwide. The festivities also include religious significance, as they commemorate the Vamana avatar of Lord Vishnu and Mahabali's request to visit his kingdom once a year. </p>
