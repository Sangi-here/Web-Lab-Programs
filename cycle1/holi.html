<img src="holi.jpeg" alt="holi" style="width:300px; height:500px;">
<p>Holi, the "Festival of Colours," celebrates the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil through vibrant celebrations of throwing colourful powders and water, singing, dancing, and feasting. The two-day festival begins with Holika Dahan, a bonfire ritual symbolizing the burning of evil, followed by a day of joyous revelry, unity, and the sharing of sweets like gujiya, as people forget differences and come together in happiness.</p>
