Fruits are essential, nutritious parts of a diet, offering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water that support health and disease prevention. They provide natural energy from sugars like glucose and fructose and aid digestion with their high fiber content. Available in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and flavors, fruits serve as a natural source of seeds and are a versatile food enjoyed fresh, in juices, dried, or as ingredients in many dishes.</h3></p></i>
