What is a Hill | Definition of Hill
A hill is a natural landform characterized by its gentle, rounded shape and elevation above the surrounding terrain, making it smaller and less steep than a mountain. While there's no formal universal definition, hills typically feature a visible summit and can be formed by geological processes like faulting or erosion. They provide elevated viewpoints, serve as habitats, and contribute to beautiful landscapes.
